## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. Jumping to solutions without understanding requirements
2. Only considering happy path (what about failures?)
3. Not discussing trade-offs ("X is always better" is a red flag)
4. Ignoring cost (unlimited budget is not realistic)
5. Over-engineering for current scale
6. Forgetting about monitoring and operations
7. Not considering data quality and validation
8. Monologue without checking if interviewer wants more depth
